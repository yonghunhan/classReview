Functions

New command is introduced: push. The command adds a new item to an array and returns the new array length.

array.push(variable)

Function is a block of codes that may be called and used repeatedly. The basic syntex of the function is as follows: 

function 'name of the function'('argument') { 'block of codes'}

As we do exercises, we are introduced to another command typeof which checks whether variables are nubers, strings, or booleans.

An object is a collection of properties, each of which is an association between a key and a value. It is a useful way of arranging data and relating items that would otherwise be listed in separate arrays. When a variable is declared as an object, it is to be written by the following syntex:
var 'object name' = {'key 1' : 'value 1', 'key 2' : 'value 2', ...}
The value may be called upon using the following syntex:
'object name'['key #']

Finally, one needs to pay a close attention to where one declares and defines variables, since declaring variables in wrong places may cause scoping issues.
