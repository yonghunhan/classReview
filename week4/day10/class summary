It can be combersome to add new html elements to the existing html document. In order to do so, one needs to: use getElementById to declare a variable, write its inner html, then declare a new variable and define it to be a new div using createElement, write its inner html, then use appendChild command to insert it in the existing div. The library of JavaScript known as jQuery can offer an easier alternative. jQuery is particularly useful if you wanted to code in a way that, when a certain element in the html document is clicked, certain event is triggered. The syntex is as follows:
$("element ID").on("click", function() {"block of code here"});
